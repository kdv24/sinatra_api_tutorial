# 01 - Hello Sinatra

## Overview

This is how I start my Sinatra apps.  I use the [shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun) gem to auto-reload my application in the browser as I make changes to the code base.  Though it isn't really necessary, it does make iterating on things quick and easy.

## Cheet Sheet

1. `cd` into the `01_hello_sinatra` lesson directory and run `$ shotgun app.rb`
1. Navigate to `localhost:9393` in your browser
1. To change lessons, kill the server and `cd` into a different lesson directory and `$ shotgun app.rb`
